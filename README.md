## General Info
This is my first dynamic site using React - view the deployed version [here](https://naomis-memes.netlify.app/)! This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and survives from the [Meme Generator API](https://imgflip.com/api).

## Learning Goals
* Understand state and implement useState()
* Consume an API using useEffect()

## Technologies
* React.JS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VSCode

## Usage

To get this set up on your local machine:
- Fork then clone this project
- In your terminal:
```
cd meme-generator
npm start
```
This will run the app in the development mode. If it doesn't open automatically, go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your broswer.
